It integrates the Model Context Protocol (MCP) with OpenAPI, enabling users to interact with various tools using standard REST/OpenAPI APIs. This integration facilitates seamless communication and operation within the platform, making it accessible and user-friendly for developers and users alike.\n\nAs a self-hosted AI platform, OPEN-WEBUI supports multiple large language models, providing flexibility and adaptability for various applications. One of its key features is the ability to run completely offline, ensuring privacy and security for users who prefer or require a disconnected environment. This offline capability is particularly beneficial for organizations or individuals who need to maintain strict data confidentiality or operate in environments with limited internet access.\n\nOPEN-WEBUI is also a powerful software tool for question-answering tasks, leveraging local models to provide accurate and efficient responses. This functionality is crucial for users who need reliable AI-driven solutions for information retrieval and decision-making processes. By supporting local models, OPEN-WEBUI ensures that users can tailor their AI interactions to specific needs and contexts, enhancing the overall utility of the platform.\n\nAdditionally, OPEN-WEBUI functions as an MCP client, capable of utilizing the DeepSeek-R1 model for tool calling. This feature allows users to execute complex tasks without the need for native function calling support, broadening the scope of applications and use cases for the platform. The ability to work with the DeepSeek-R1 model further underscores OPEN-WEBUI's commitment to providing robust and flexible AI solutions.\n\nIn summary, OPEN-WEBUI is a comprehensive, self-hosted AI platform that integrates MCP with OpenAPI to facilitate user interaction with large language models through standard APIs. Its offline capabilities, support for question-answering tasks with local models, and compatibility with the DeepSeek-R1 model for tool calling make it a powerful and adaptable tool for a wide range of AI applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693147, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 386, "prompt_tokens": 251, "total_tokens": 637, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
