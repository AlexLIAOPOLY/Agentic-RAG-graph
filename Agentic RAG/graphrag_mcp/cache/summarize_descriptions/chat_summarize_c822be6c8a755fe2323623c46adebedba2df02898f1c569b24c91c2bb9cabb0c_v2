It is a communication mode that facilitates real-time data push, allowing servers to transmit updates directly to clients. SSE is supported by MCP, which enhances its capability to deliver real-time information efficiently. This protocol is particularly useful for applications that require continuous updates, as it enables a seamless flow of data from the server to the client without the need for the client to repeatedly request new information. By maintaining a persistent connection, SSE ensures that clients receive timely updates, making it an ideal solution for scenarios where real-time data delivery is crucial.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693154, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 210, "total_tokens": 337, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
