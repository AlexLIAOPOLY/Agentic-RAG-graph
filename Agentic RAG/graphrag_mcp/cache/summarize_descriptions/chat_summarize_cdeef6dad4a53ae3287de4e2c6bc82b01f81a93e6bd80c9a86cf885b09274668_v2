It serves as a unified communication interface that standardizes message formats and communication methods between large-scale models, clients, and servers. This protocol supports various transmission mechanisms, including standard input/output (stdio), Server-Sent Events (SSE), and Streamable HTTP, facilitating both local and remote communication.\n\nMCP is particularly focused on improving the efficiency of developing large model agents by providing standardized interfaces for AI models to interact with external systems. This standardization helps solve the fragmentation of traditional API interfaces, enabling dynamic data interaction, security, and extensibility across various applications. The protocol is designed to unify communication between large-scale models and tools, allowing for seamless integration and interaction.\n\nThe framework is versatile, supporting the development of AI data analysis agents, weather servers, and other server-based applications. It allows developers to quickly develop servers using languages like TypeScript (TS) and Java, and connect them to various clients, including Claude models and other local or online large models. MCP is also used in projects like MCP-Server-DeepResearch, where it aids in managing Python projects and handling complex dependencies.\n\nMCP's ecosystem includes development tools and pre-developed tools for external tool calling, making it a robust platform for creating and managing servers and clients. It supports the creation of servers and clients, as demonstrated in implementations like FastMCP and MCPClient, and is used for managing requests and responses, including initializing connections and handling tool lists.\n\nThe protocol is an open standard, facilitating efficient and secure interaction between AI models and external data sources and tools. It enhances the functionality of platforms like Cherry Studio by enabling interaction with external tools and services. Additionally, MCP can be integrated with systems like Cursor for enhanced server management functionality.\n\nIntroduced by Anthropic, MCP aims to standardize the development process of intelligent agents, improving efficiency by streamlining the function calling process and enabling easier integration with external tools. This makes it a critical component in the development of intelligent agents and AI systems, providing a standardized, efficient, and secure framework for communication and interaction.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693138, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 436, "prompt_tokens": 926, "total_tokens": 1362, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
