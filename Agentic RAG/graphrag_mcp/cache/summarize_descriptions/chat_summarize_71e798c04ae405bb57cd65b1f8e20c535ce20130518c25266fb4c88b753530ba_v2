This innovative framework aims to improve the reasoning capabilities of large language models, particularly in the context of question-answering tasks. By integrating knowledge graphs, GraphRAG significantly boosts the performance of language models when dealing with private or large, complex datasets. \n\nThe system provides enhanced search capabilities, which are crucial for its function as an API used for global search and configuration loading within code environments. To achieve optimal performance, GraphRAG requires prompt tuning, ensuring that the system is finely adjusted to meet specific user needs and data requirements. This tuning process is essential for maximizing the efficiency and accuracy of the search and retrieval functions that GraphRAG offers.\n\nOverall, GraphRAG represents a significant advancement in the field of language model enhancement, offering a robust solution for improving the interaction between large language models and extensive datasets through the use of sophisticated knowledge graph integration.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693156, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 198, "prompt_tokens": 249, "total_tokens": 447, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
