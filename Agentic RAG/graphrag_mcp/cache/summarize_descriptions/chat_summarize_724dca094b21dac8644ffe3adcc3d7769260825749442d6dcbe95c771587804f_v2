This technical design facilitates the indirect calling of these tools by large models through the creation of intermediary functions. In this process, the MCP Client plays a crucial role by deciding which tool to use based on the output generated by the model. This approach allows for a seamless integration between the model's capabilities and the external tools, enhancing the overall functionality and efficiency of the system.
