MCP servers are designed to support SSE, which is a protocol option that enables the transmission of updates from the server to the client. This integration allows MCP to effectively push real-time data, ensuring that clients receive timely updates as they occur. By utilizing SSE, MCP servers can maintain a continuous connection with clients, providing a seamless and efficient method for streaming data. This capability is particularly beneficial for applications that require constant data updates, as it minimizes latency and enhances the overall user experience.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693164, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 127, "prompt_tokens": 184, "total_tokens": 311, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
