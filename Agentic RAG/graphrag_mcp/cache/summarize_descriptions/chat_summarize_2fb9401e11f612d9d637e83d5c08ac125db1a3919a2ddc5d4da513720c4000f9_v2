While HTTP, or Hypertext Transfer Protocol, is widely recognized as a foundational protocol for data exchange on the web, MCP leverages HTTP's capabilities to facilitate remote communication between clients and servers. By utilizing HTTP for transmitting requests and responses, MCP ensures a reliable and standardized method for data exchange, thereby supporting and complementing HTTP's role in network communications. This integration allows MCP to build upon the established infrastructure of HTTP, enhancing its functionality and enabling more efficient development processes.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693160, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 122, "prompt_tokens": 191, "total_tokens": 313, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
