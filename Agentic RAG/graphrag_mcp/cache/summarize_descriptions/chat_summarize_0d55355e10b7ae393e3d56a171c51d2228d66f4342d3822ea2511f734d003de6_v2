It serves as a critical environment where external functions operate within the MCP framework, as defined by the protocol. The server is designed to host external tools and communicate effectively with MCP clients, providing essential services through the MCP SDK.\n\nAs a server script, the MCP Server facilitates the connection of MCP Clients for task execution, ensuring seamless interaction and data exchange. It is a lightweight, independent program capable of connecting various local or remote data sources and external services through a standardized MCP interface. This connectivity allows the server to provide corresponding functions as per protocol requirements, making it a crucial tool in handling specific tasks or offering external data support.\n\nThe MCP Server is also a key component in the DeepResearch project, where it is employed to implement deep research functionalities. It supports the execution of both Python and Node.js scripts, demonstrating its flexibility and adaptability in different programming environments. Additionally, the server can be accessed via HTTP mode for testing purposes, further enhancing its utility and accessibility.\n\nOverall, the MCP Server is a robust and efficient tool that plays a pivotal role in the execution and management of tasks within the MCP framework, supporting a wide range of applications and services in the field of AI and machine learning.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693150, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 273, "prompt_tokens": 366, "total_tokens": 639, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
