As an organization, CURSOR announced its support for MCP in February, which played a pivotal role in bringing the protocol to the forefront of developers' attention and significantly increasing its visibility within the developer community.\n\nAs a platform, CURSOR is a versatile tool that can be configured to call MCP servers, providing a robust environment for managing and interacting with these servers. It functions as a client tool that interacts with MCP servers, although it currently has limited support for HTTP streaming. CURSOR is also a modern Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that integrates AI functionalities to enhance coding efficiency and the overall developer experience. This IDE supports code completion, error detection, and optimization suggestions, making it a valuable asset for developers seeking to improve their coding practices.\n\nFurthermore, CURSOR integrates AI technology to assist developers with various tasks, including code generation, context management, and terminal operations, all aimed at enhancing programming efficiency. The platform allows users to add and manage MCP tools, providing a comprehensive environment for development purposes. It supports direct server calls, enabling developers to connect to numerous open-source MCP servers and quickly write MCP servers themselves.\n\nIn summary, CURSOR is both an organization and a platform that has made significant strides in supporting and integrating MCP functionality. Its modern IDE, equipped with AI capabilities, offers a comprehensive suite of tools designed to improve coding efficiency and developer productivity. By facilitating the management and interaction with MCP servers, CURSOR has established itself as a crucial player in the development community, promoting the adoption and visibility of the MCP protocol.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693147, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 340, "prompt_tokens": 372, "total_tokens": 712, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
