Introduced by Anthropic in November 2024, MCP provides a standardized interface that allows AI models to seamlessly interact with external tools and data sources. This protocol is particularly beneficial for developers as it enables the sharing and reuse of external tools developed around a specific API, thereby significantly reducing development time and effort. Additionally, MCP includes a Model-Connect-Protocol service that automates the entire process from resource management to deployment, further streamlining the development workflow. Through these capabilities, MCP serves as a crucial tool in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of AI model development.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693147, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 145, "prompt_tokens": 278, "total_tokens": 423, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
