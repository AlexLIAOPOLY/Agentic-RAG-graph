These models are accessible through their official API, which can be integrated into various platforms, such as Cherry Studio. DEEPSEEK's API service is particularly versatile, as it can be used with GraphRAG for efficient indexing and querying, making it a valuable tool for developers and businesses looking to leverage advanced AI capabilities.\n\nThe DeepSeek models are designed to be highly configurable, allowing integration with OpenAI and other local models, which provides users with flexibility in choosing the best model for their specific needs. One of the standout features of DeepSeek is its implementation of function calling capabilities, particularly in its advanced versions like DeepSeek-V3. This feature enhances the models' ability to perform complex tasks and utilize advanced tools effectively.\n\nIn addition to providing cutting-edge AI models, DEEPSEEK also offers a program or course that provides advanced training in model principles and training practices. This educational offering includes the latest versions of their models, such as V3 and R1, ensuring that participants are well-versed in the most current AI technologies and methodologies.\n\nOverall, DEEPSEEK stands out as a comprehensive provider of AI solutions, offering both powerful models and educational resources to support the development and implementation of AI technologies across various industries.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693147, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 276, "prompt_tokens": 275, "total_tokens": 551, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
