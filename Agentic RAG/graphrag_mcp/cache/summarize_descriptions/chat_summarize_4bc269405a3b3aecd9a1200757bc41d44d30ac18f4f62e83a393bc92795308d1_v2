It achieves its impressive speed by utilizing `uvloop` and `httptools`, which are instrumental in enhancing its performance. Uvicorn is commonly used to run Starlette applications, making it a popular choice for developers seeking efficient and reliable server solutions for their asynchronous web applications. By leveraging the power of `uvloop`, a fast event loop, and `httptools`, a library for HTTP parsing, Uvicorn ensures that applications can handle numerous simultaneous connections with minimal latency. This makes it particularly well-suited for modern web applications that require high concurrency and low response times.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693155, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 135, "prompt_tokens": 182, "total_tokens": 317, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
