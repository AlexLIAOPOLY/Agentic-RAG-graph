As an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) client, CLINE facilitates direct server calls, streamlining the development process by allowing developers to interact with servers seamlessly. This functionality is particularly beneficial for developers who require efficient server communication during the development cycle.\n\nIn addition to its IDE capabilities, CLINE also functions as a Model Control Protocol (MCP) client. It leverages prompt templates to enable function calling with the DeepSeek-R1 model. This feature is crucial for users who need to interact with advanced machine learning models, as it simplifies the process of executing complex functions and retrieving results from the DeepSeek-R1 model.\n\nOverall, CLINE is a powerful tool that integrates development and machine learning functionalities, making it an essential asset for developers and data scientists alike.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693150, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 171, "prompt_tokens": 178, "total_tokens": 349, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
