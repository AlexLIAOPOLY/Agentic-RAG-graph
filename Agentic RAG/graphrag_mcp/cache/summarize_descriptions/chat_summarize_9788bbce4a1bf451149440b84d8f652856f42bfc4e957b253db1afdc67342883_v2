Primarily, it utilizes the OpenWeather-API-KEY to fetch and provide weather information, making it a valuable tool for users seeking real-time weather updates. This functionality is accessible through PyPI, allowing for easy installation and integration into various applications or systems that require weather data.\n\nIn addition to its weather-related capabilities, MCP-Weather-HTTP also functions as a server name within Cherry Studio. In this context, it is used for connecting to the MCP server in streaming HTTP mode. This dual functionality highlights the project's adaptability and utility in both weather data retrieval and server communication environments.\n\nOverall, MCP-Weather-HTTP stands out as a comprehensive solution for users needing reliable weather information and efficient server connectivity, demonstrating its importance in both meteorological and technological applications.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693155, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 173, "prompt_tokens": 203, "total_tokens": 376, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
