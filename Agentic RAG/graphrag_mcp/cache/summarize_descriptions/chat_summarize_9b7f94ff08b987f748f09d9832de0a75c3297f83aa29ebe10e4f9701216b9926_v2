The MCP was proposed as an open standard by Anthropic, aiming to establish a protocol specifically designed for the development of intelligent agents. This initiative underscores Anthropic's commitment to advancing AI technology and fostering innovation within the industry.\n\nTo support the adoption and development of the MCP, Anthropic provides a range of tools and Software Development Kits (SDKs). These resources are intended to facilitate the integration and utilization of the MCP protocol, making it accessible for developers and organizations interested in leveraging this technology. By offering these tools, Anthropic not only promotes the widespread adoption of the MCP but also ensures that developers have the necessary resources to effectively implement and benefit from the protocol.\n\nIn summary, Anthropic's introduction of the Model Context Protocol represents a significant step forward in the realm of intelligent agent development. By proposing MCP as an open standard and supporting it with comprehensive development tools and SDKs, Anthropic is playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of AI technology.", "refusal": null, "role": "assistant", "annotations": [], "audio": null, "function_call": null, "tool_calls": null}}], "created": 1753693160, "model": "gpt-4o-2024-08-06", "object": "chat.completion", "service_tier": "default", "system_fingerprint": "fp_a288987b44", "usage": {"completion_tokens": 217, "prompt_tokens": 238, "total_tokens": 455, "completion_tokens_details": {"accepted_prediction_tokens": 0, "audio_tokens": 0, "reasoning_tokens": 0, "rejected_prediction_tokens": 0}, "prompt_tokens_details": {"audio_tokens": 0, "cached_tokens": 0}}}, "input": {"messages": [{"content": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or more entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
