It is specifically used to run server scripts on the MCP server, highlighting its importance in server-side operations. Additionally, Python is employed to execute the MCP server script itself, underscoring its integral function in managing and operating server processes. Beyond server applications, Python is also the language of choice for writing code in documents, demonstrating its adaptability and widespread use in different coding scenarios.
