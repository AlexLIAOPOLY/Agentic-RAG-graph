Given a search term, you search the web for that term and\"\n    \"produce a concise summary of the results. The summary must 2-3 paragraphs and less than 300\"\n    \"words. Capture the main points.

Do not include any additional commentary other than the summary\"\n    \"itself.\"\n)\n```\n\n这是模型的行为提示，翻译一下这段内容的精髓：\n\n| 指令含义                           | 说明                                    |\n| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |\n| 你是一个研究助手                   | 模拟一个能查资料的人                    |\n| 给你关键词后上网搜索               | 关键词来自 planner_agent                |\n| 写出 2-3 段简洁总结                | 每次搜索结果必须压缩成 300 字以内的摘要 |\n| 用要点式语言、可以语法不完整       | 不要求像论文，重点是信息密度高          |\n| 不要添加自己的评论                 | 不能主观判断，只提取信息                |\n| 最终目的是为后续写报告的人准备素材 | 所以格式自由，内容集中就行              |\n\n接下来创建创建 Agent 对象\n\n```python\nsearch_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"Search agent\",\n    instructions=INSTRUCTIONS,\n    tools=[WebSearchTool()],\n    model_settings=ModelSettings(tool_choice=\"required\"),\n)\n```\n\n其中`name=\"Search agent\"`是Agent 名称，用于日志和上下文显示。而`instructions=INSTRUCTIONS`告诉大语言模型它要怎么完成任务。`tools=[WebSearchTool()]`设置它可以使用的工具。在这个 case 中，它只能用 `WebSearchTool`，这是 SDK 内置的网页搜索工具。而`model_settings=ModelSettings(tool_choice=\"required\")`则表示：**强制要求模型一定要调用工具（WebSearchTool）来完成任务**。不允许模型“凭空回答”或“胡编搜索内容”，这有助于提升真实性。\n\n总结流程如下：\n\n```\n关键词（来自 planner_agent） → search_agent →\n     🔍 使用 WebSearchTool 搜索\n     ✂️ 根据结果生成 2-3 段摘要\n     📦 返回给 writer_agent 写整合报告\n```\n\n带入planner_agent的一个搜索条目后运行效果如下：\n\n\n\n#### 2.5 writer_agent功能实现\n\n​\t最后则是writer_agent的功能介绍，其核心代码如下：\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom agents import Agent\n\nPROMPT_TEMP = (\n    \"You are a senior researcher tasked with writing a cohesive report for a research query. \"\n    \"You will be provided with the original query, and some initial research done by a research \"\n    \"assistant.\\n\"\n    \"You should first come up with an outline for the report that describes the structure and \"\n    \"flow of the report.
