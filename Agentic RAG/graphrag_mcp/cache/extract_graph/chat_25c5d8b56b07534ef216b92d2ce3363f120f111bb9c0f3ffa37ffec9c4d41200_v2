MCP入门介绍\nMCP，全称是Model Context Protocol，模型上下文协议，由Claude母公司Anthropic于去年11月正式提出。\n\nimage-20250318201338022\n\nMCP刚发布的时候不温不火，直到今年Agent大爆发才被广泛关注。而在今年2月，Cursor正式宣布加入MCP功能支持，一举将MCP推到了全体开发人员面前。从本质上来说，MCP是一种技术协议，一种智能体Agent开发过程中共同约定的一种规范。这就好比秦始皇的“书同文、车同轨”，在统一的规范下，大家的协作效率就能大幅提高，最终提升智能体Agent的开发效率。截止目前，已上千种MCP工具诞生，在强悍的MCP生态加持下， 人人手搓Manus的时代即将到来。\n\n7分钟讲清楚MCP是什么？https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1uXQzYaEpJ/\n\nimage-20250318201253260\n\n总的来说，MCP解决的最大痛点，就是Agent开发中调用外部工具的技术门槛过高的问题。\n\n我们都知道，能调用外部工具，是大模型进化为智能体Agent的关键，如果不能使用外部工具，大模型就只能是个简单的聊天机器人，甚至连查询天气都做不到。由于底层技术限制啊，大模型本身是无法和外部\n######################\nOutput:", "role": "user"}], "parameters": {"model": "gpt-4o", "frequency_penalty": 0.0, "max_tokens": null, "n": 1, "presence_penalty": 0.0, "temperature": 0.0, "top_p": 1.0}}, "key": "chat_25c5d8b56b07534ef216b92d2ce3363f120f111bb9c0f3ffa37ffec9c4d41200_v2"}
