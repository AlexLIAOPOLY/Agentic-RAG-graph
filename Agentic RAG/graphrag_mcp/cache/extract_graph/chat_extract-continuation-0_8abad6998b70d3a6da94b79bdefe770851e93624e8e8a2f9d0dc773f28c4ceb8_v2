借助uv创建Python项目\n\n​\tMCP开发要求借助uv进行虚拟环境创建和依赖管理。`uv` 是一个**Python 依赖管理工具**，类似于 `pip` 和 `conda`，但它更快、更高效，并且可以更好地管理 Python 虚拟环境和依赖项。它的核心目标是**替代 `pip`、`venv` 和 `pip-tools`**，提供更好的性能和更低的管理开销。\n\n**`uv` 的特点**：\n\n1. **速度更快**：相比 `pip`，`uv` 采用 Rust 编写，性能更优。\n2. **支持 PEP 582**：无需 `virtualenv`，可以直接使用 `__pypackages__` 进行管理。\n3. **兼容 `pip`**：支持 `requirements.txt` 和 `pyproject.toml` 依赖管理。\n4. **替代 `venv`**：提供 `uv venv` 进行虚拟环境管理，比 `venv` 更轻量。\n5. **跨平台**：支持 Windows、macOS 和 Linux。\n\n​\t以Ubuntu系统为例，首先使用pip安装uv：\n\n```bash\npip install uv\n```\n\n> 此外，也可以直接使用curl安装uv\n>\n> ```bash\n> curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh\n> ```\n\n然后按照如下流程创建项目主目录：\n\n```bash\n# cd /root/autodl-tmp/MCP\n\n# 创建项目目录\nuv init mcp-server-deepresearch\ncd mcp-server-deepresearch\n```\n\n\n\n\n\n然后输入如下命令创建虚拟环境：\n\n```bash\n# 创建虚拟环境\nuv venv\n\n# 激活虚拟环境\nsource .venv/bin/activate\n```\n\n此时就构建了一个基础项目结构：\n\n\n\n各文件解释如下：\n\n| 文件/文件夹       | 作用             |\n| ----------------- | ---------------- |\n| `.git/`           | Git 版本控制目录 |\n| `.venv/`          | 虚拟环境         |\n| `.gitignore`      | Git 忽略规则     |\n| `.python-version` | Python版本声明   |\n| `main.py`         | 主程序入口       |\n| `pyproject.toml`  | 项目配置文件     |\n| `README.md`       | 项目说明文档     |\n\n#### Step 2. 添加项目依赖\n\n​\t接下来继续使用uv工具，为我们的项目添加基础依赖。根据此前的代码解释不难看出，当前项目主要需要用到`openai`和`openai-agents`这两个库，我们可以使用如下命令安装相关依赖，并同时安装mcp sdk：\n\n```bash\n# 安装 MCP SDK\nuv add mcp openai openai-agents asyncio typing pydantic\n```\n\n\n\n注意，对于uv管理库来说，相关依赖会安装到.venv文件中，并不会和系统库产生冲突。\n\n#### Step 3.编写项目源码\n\n​\t接下来在主目录下创建`/src/mcp_server_deepresearch`作为代码主目录\n\n```bash\nmkdir -p ./src/mcp_server_deepresearch\ncd ./src/mcp_server_deepresearch\n```\n\n然后创建server.py脚本，作为整个DeepResearch MCP服务器的核心脚本，\n\n\n\n并写入代码如下：\n\n```python\nimport asyncio\nimport argparse\nfrom typing import List\nfrom mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP\nfrom openai import AsyncOpenAI\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\nfrom agents import OpenAIChatCompletionsModel,Agent,Runner,set_default_openai_client,
