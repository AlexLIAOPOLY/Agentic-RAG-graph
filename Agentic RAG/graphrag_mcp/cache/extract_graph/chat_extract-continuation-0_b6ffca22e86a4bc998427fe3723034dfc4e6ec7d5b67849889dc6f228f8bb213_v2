Given a query, come up with a set of web searches \"\n    \"to perform to best answer the query. Output between 10 and 20 terms to query for.\"\n)\n\n\nclass WebSearchItem(BaseModel):\n    reason: str\n    \"Your reasoning for why this search is important to the query.\"\n\n    query: str\n    \"The search term to use for the web search.\"\n\n\nclass WebSearchPlan(BaseModel):\n    searches: list[WebSearchItem]\n    \"\"\"A list of web searches to perform to best answer the query.\"\"\"\n\n\nplanner_agent = Agent(\n    name=\"PlannerAgent\",\n    instructions=PROMPT,\n    model=\"o4-mini\",\n    output_type=WebSearchPlan,\n)\n```\n\n​\t其中Planner Agent 的职责是接收一个研究主题，生成一份“搜索计划（WebSearchPlan）”，告诉系统应该搜索哪些子问题/关键词以及搜索这些关键词的理由。具体代码解释如下：\n\n```python\nfrom pydantic import BaseModel\n```\n\n导入 Pydantic，用于定义结构化数据模型。它是整个 Agents SDK 中用于**类型校验 + 数据结构定义**的核心库。\n\n```python\nfrom agents import Agent\n```\n\n导入 SDK 的核心类 `Agent`，我们后面会实例化一个具体的 Agent 实体 `planner_agent`。\n\n```python\nPROMPT = (\n    \"You are a helpful research assistant. Given a query, come up with a set of web searches \"\n    \"to perform to best answer the query. Output between 20 and 30 terms to query for.\"\n)\n```\n\n定义这个 Agent 的提示词（Prompt），告诉 LLM：\n\n- 你是一个研究助手；\n- 收到一个主题后，请生成 20 到 30 条搜索建议；\n- 每条建议应当包括 **搜索关键词 + 搜索原因**。\n\n\n接下来是两个重要的数据结构定义：\n\n```python\nclass WebSearchItem(BaseModel):\n    reason: str\n    \"Your reasoning for why this search is important to the query.\"\n\n    query: str\n    \"The search term to use for the web search.\"\n```\n\n这是一个“单个搜索建议”的结构，包含两个字段：\n\n| 字段     | 说明                                           |\n| -------- | ---------------------------------------------- |\n| `reason` | 你为什么要搜索这个关键词？（用于解释搜索动机） |\n| `query`  | 你要搜索的关键词本身                           |\n\n\n```python\nclass WebSearchPlan(BaseModel):\n    searches: list[WebSearchItem]\n    \"\"\"A list of web searches to perform to best answer the query.\"\"\"\n```\n\n这是“搜索计划”的整体结构，包含一个列表 `searches`，每项是上面的 `WebSearchItem`。\n\n其中模型输出结构化的关键在这：\n\n```python\noutput_type=WebSearchPlan,\n```\n\n它告诉 `planner_agent` **“你必须输出一份结构化的 WebSearchPlan 对象，里面包含多个 WebSearchItem。”**这样可以约束模型输出格式，也便于下一步自动解析内容。\n\n​\t实际运行效果如下：\n\n\n\n输出了14个搜索关键词和对应的搜索原因。\n\n#### 2.4 search_agent功能实现\n\n​\t接下来是负责实际执行搜索工作的search_agent，代码如下：\n\n```python\nfrom agents import Agent, WebSearchTool\nfrom agents.model_settings import ModelSettings\n\nINSTRUCTIONS = (\n    \"You are a research assistant. Given a search term, you search the web for that term and \"\n    \"produce a concise summary of the results. The summary must 2-3 paragraphs and less than 300 \"\n    \"words.
