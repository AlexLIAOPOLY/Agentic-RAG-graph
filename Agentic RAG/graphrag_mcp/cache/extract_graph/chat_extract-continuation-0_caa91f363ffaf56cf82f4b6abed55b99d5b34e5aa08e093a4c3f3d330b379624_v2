calling的进阶功能外，接下来我们继续介绍如何基于上述功能，来进行MCP智能体快速发开发，来搭建一个能够进行SQL查询和Python自动编写的入门级数据分析智能体。\n\n1. miniMateGen项目初始化\ncd /root/autodl-tmp/MCP\n# 创建项目目录\nuv init miniMateGen\ncd miniMateGen\nimage-20250320112530253\n\n# 创建虚拟环境\nuv venv\n​\n# 激活虚拟环境\nsource .venv/bin/activate\nimage-20250320112559581\n\n创建项目如下：\n\nimage-20250320191417271\n\n2. 创建MCP服务器一：SQL_server\n2.1 Linux环境下安装MySQL服务器并创建简单数据集\n创建MySQL数据库\n\napt install mysql-server\nimage-20250214175933719\n\n然后启动mysql，并设置初始密码：\n\nmysqld &\nmysql\n进入到SQL命令行后，输入如下命令：\n\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY '123';\n此处密码可根据实际需求设置。\n\nimage-20250214181533818\n\n然后输入exit;即可退出。\n\n然后再次进入MySQL，并根据要求输入密码：\n\nmysql -u root -p\n然后创建一个数据库：\n\nCREATE DATABASE school;\nUSE school;\n然后创建一个虚拟表格，里面包含了10位同学各自3门课程的分数：\n\nCREATE TABLE students_scores (\n    id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,  \n    name VARCHAR(50),                   \n    course1 INT,                        \n    course2 INT,                       \n    course3 INT                        \n);\nINSERT INTO students_scores (name, course1, course2, course3)\nVALUES\n    ('学生1', 85, 92, 78),\n    ('学生2', 76, 88, 91),\n    ('学生3', 90, 85, 80),\n    ('学生4', 65, 70, 72),\n    ('学生5', 82, 89, 95),\n    ('学生6', 91, 93, 87),\n    ('学生7', 77, 78, 85),\n    ('学生8', 88, 92, 91),\n    ('学生9', 84, 76, 80),\n    ('学生10', 89, 90, 92);\nimage-20250214182224214\n\n然后即可查看数据集基本情况：\n\nSELECT * FROM students_scores;\nimage-20250214182305761\n\n此外，还需要刷新身份验证，使得其他库（如pymysql）可以通过密码验证登录：\n\nALTER USER 'root'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY '123';\nimage-20250214183946616\n\n2.2 编写SQL_server.py代码\n功能示意图\n\nimage-20250320192252182\n\n代码位置\n\n\n\n需要增加额外依赖：\n\nuv add pymysql numpy
